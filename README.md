# Remind A.I.
#### Written by Kevin M. Delgado

## About:
Remind A.I. is a web application that will remind users to stand when sitting for prolonged periods of time. With permission, it will utilize your computer/laptop's front-facing camera to track in real-time whether you are sitting or standing. If you are sitting for a user-defined period of time, it will either send a notification or signal an alarm depending on the user's preference.

## Note:
Project only supports Google Chrome web browser at the moment. More to work on ...


## How to Use:
The first thing you will need to do, once on the app, is enable your camera. You'll need to enable access to your front-facing camera. You will only need to do this once. After, you can customize the two features before you can start running a session:

1. The maximum length of time (in minutes) you can sit before you will be notified by Remind A.I. to stand.
2. Whether you prefer to either receive notice as an alarm or popup notification.

## Create an Account:
On Remind A.I., you can also create an account to keep track of your sit vs. standing activity. This was accomplished through the use of Google Firebase (GCP)

## Tracking:
On your account, you'll be able to view your previous sessions. You'll be able to view time series plots of when you were sitting and standing during your sessions.
